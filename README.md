# ARIES - Low voltage smArt gRid dIscrete Event Simulator to Enable Large Scale Learning in the Power Distribution Networks
ARIES meant to enable large scale learning and easy smart grid applications design and testing. ARIES is designed according to object oriented best practices, and it is implemented in Python 3. ARIES is equipped with a REST API to actively interact with the simulations, it features a simulation results storage system based on a MongoDB database, and a event management system based on a redis in-memory data structure store used as message broker.

# Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to example/test to run simulation
3. Run `docker-compose up`

# Dependencies
To run the simulation you need to install Docker engine and also Docker compose.
